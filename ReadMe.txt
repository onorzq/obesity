The digital assignment 2 is a game prototype of Analog assignment 2 Obesity.

There is only one player and can be control by pressing left or right key.
Press Left: the character moving to left horizontally.
Press Right: the character moving to right horizontally.

*The character cannot go out of the screen.
**Any parts of the character touch the food dropping from sky can eat the food.

The code is modified from Phaser examples Invaders and Starstruck.
http://examples.phaser.io/index.html
The character part is from the Starstruck example.
The food dropping is modified from the Invaders example.
The game over and restart mechanism is from Invaders example.
The other parts of the game are from courses material, other Phaser examples and my own originality.
